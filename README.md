Simple android app that manages intents from one page to another, takes and saves pictures, handles user consent for use of camera/precise geolocation so metadata can be added, updates geolocation if user moves. Also mimicking DB - APP interaction (intended, just wanted to make my android app)

Project realized on personal time.
